# 3D_Environmental_Art_Dev
anything that helps make terrains and ecosystems (including plants and props like buildings, park benches) quicker, higher quality for the same or smaller dev time. As I continue to learn modelling in 3D Studio Max, procedural 3D development in Houdini, nVidia Game Works, Z-Brush, Substance Designer & Substance Painter, etc... I will continually upload Unreal Engine Setups... including having the environmental lighting set up, AI, blueprints, etc.
